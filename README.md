# Process Modeling and Optimization of a Car Workshop

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling the business processes of a car repair workshop using BPMN 2.0 and eEPC (Extended Event-Driven Process Chain). 
The aim was to identify inefficiencies, define performance metrics, and propose improvements that align with real-world operational workflows in a workshop setting.

## Problem  
The car workshop experienced:
- Long customer wait times.
- Inefficient manual processes for estimates and approvals.
- Poor communication across departments.
- No performance tracking or process visibility.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
-BPMN 2.0 for detailed, role-based workflow modeling  
-eEPC for high-level process visualization with events, functions, and organizational units  
- Lucidchart / Draw.io for diagram creation  
- KPI Framework to measure process performance

---

## Key Deliverables  
- BPMN Collaboration Diagrams covering:
  - Vehicle intake
  - Diagnosis and estimate creation
  - Repair execution
  - Customer communication and handover

- eEPC Diagrams showing:
  - End-to-end process logic from event to outcome
  - Organizational responsibilities and system support

- KPI Metrics Defined:
  - Average Repair Time
  - Customer Waiting Time
  - First-Time Fix Rate
  - Estimate Approval Time
  - Mechanic Utilization Rate

## Insights Gained  
- Learned to apply process modeling standards in real scenarios  
- Developed structured thinking around bottlenecks and optimization  
- Understood how to tie business processes to performance metrics  
- Strengthened collaboration and project documentation skills

## Outcome  
The project concluded with actionable improvements:
- Introduced automation suggestions (e.g., auto-approvals via ERP).
- Improved task distribution between roles (receptionist, mechanic, cashier).
- Proposed integration of KPI dashboards for monitoring service quality.
